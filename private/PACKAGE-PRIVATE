The coal.private package contains classes or other facilities
that are an integral part of the implementation but also
should be hidden from the user as to grant flexibility for the
implementor.

The interface the user sees is purposefully abstracted so that
it may be possible in the future to provide an implementation
that for instance features GC or other things like that.
